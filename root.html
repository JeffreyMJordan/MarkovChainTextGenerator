        <h2>About Markov Chains</h2>
        <div class="about-text">
          <p></p>
          Markov chains are mathematical systems consisting of a series of states, 
          a set of transitions between each state, and a set of probabilities for each of these transitions occuring.
          <p></p>
          As an example, consider this simple markov chain modeling the weather:
          <p></p>
          <div class="image-container">
              <img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-u9XslQrACb8/VK71Cym3zQI/AAAAAAAAAA0/DAxkKTcCKvc/s1600/markovdiag.png" alt="markov chain image">
          </div>
          <p></p>
          This markov chain has 3 states: rainy, cloudy, and sunny. For each state, there is some probability for it transitioning to a 
          different state or remaining in its current state. When the weather is rainy, it tends to remain rainy. When it's sunny, it tends to remain sunny. And when 
          it's cloudy, it doesn't stay that way for very long. 
          <p></p>
          Markov chains also be used to model languages based on a given corpus. To demonstrate how this is possible, consider the sample corpus: 
          <p></p>
          <div class="image-container">
            <p></p>
            "John had many cats and dogs and fishes"
            <p></p>
          </div>
          <p></p>
          We can model this corpus through the following process by mapping every word to an array containing all the words 
          succeeding it. At the end of our process, we'll have the following hash:
         <p></p>
          <div class="hash-container">
              
            {John => [had], had => [many], many => [cats], cats => [and], and => [dogs, fishes], dogs => [and], fishes => []}
              
          </div>
          <p></p>
          We can use this hash to generate text as follows: 
          <p></p>
          <div class="image-container">
            <ol>
              <li>Pick a random key from the hash</li>
              <li>Append this key to our sentence</li>
              <li>Choose a random word from the array mapped to this key</li>
              <li>Make this word our new key and return to step 2</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <p></p> 
          When making our Markov chain, we aren't limited to using single words as our keys. We can also create Markov chains using bigrams (ex. "John had" => [many]) 
          or trigrams (ex. "John had many" => [cats]) 
        </div>
      </div>
