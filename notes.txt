I think I should have the chain generation happen in util, then be dispatched to the rest of the state 
This should be the same for text generation 

I could also have some step-by-step text generation 
Not really sure how to do this...
I could just make a really long promise chain of stuff... 
I could have a 'chain' component, which I updated with the key and the mapped array 
  I'm not sure how to not make this look choppy 
  I want to emphasize that it's selecting something from the array 
  Umm uhh 
  could have it highlight the thing it ends up selecting, but this seems like it requires more actions
  That might be the only way... 
  I could have it dispatch something like a 'send-selection' to the state 
  Then it changes the key...
  I really need some help on this
  Maybe this isn't even practical 
I could also have a sentence component which I update when I add a word to the sentence
